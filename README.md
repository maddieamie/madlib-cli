### Tests

_How do you run tests?_
I ran user tests of both the "dark and stormy" text as well as the longer "make me a video game" text, to make sure they functioned as expected. After all the tests on the smaller template were passing, I ran user tests on the larger template as well. 


_Any tests of note?_
N/A

_Describe any tests that you did not complete, skipped, etc_

I did not write any additional tests for the larger template in this lab.
