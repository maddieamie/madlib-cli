Make Me A Video Game!

I the {Adjective} and {Adjective} {A First Name} have {Past Tense Verb} {A First Name}'s {Adjective} sibling and plan to steal their {Adjective} {Plural Noun}!

What are a {Large Animal} and backpacking {Small Animal} to do? Before you can help {A First Name}, you'll have to collect the {Adjective} {Plural Noun} and {Adjective} {Plural Noun} that open up the {Number Under 50} worlds connected to {A First Name}'s Lair. There are {Number} {Plural Noun} and {Number} {Plural Noun} in the game, along with hundreds of other goodies for you to find.
